                    <p>My name is Alexandre and I was born and currently reside in São Paulo, Brazil with my wife. I work as an electrical engineer at an architecture firm. My wife, who is incredibly beautiful and loving, is someone I enjoy spending time with, whether it's having conversations or going out together. In my free time, I love learning new things, playing board games with friends, and spending quality time with my wife.</p>

                    <p>Brazil is the 5th biggest country in the world with more than 200 milion inhabitants. Recent research has shown that Brazil has the population that bathes the most in the world, averaging 14 baths per week, that is, 2 baths per day. This is due to the fact that the country’s climate is tropical, which in most cases, means that we have many hot seasons in various places. The number of baths is also due to the fact that the indigenous peoples of the Brazilian region, long before Portuguese colonization, had high hygiene habits, already taking daily baths since before 1500 AD. Their hygiene habits also included hair cutting and washing, and depilation.</p>
